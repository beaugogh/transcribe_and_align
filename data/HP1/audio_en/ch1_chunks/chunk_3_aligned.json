  "en": " Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man, with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde, and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful, as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley, and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.",
  "zh": "弗农·德思礼先⽣在⼀家名叫格朗宁的公司做主管，公司⽣产钻机。他⾼⼤魁梧，胖得⼏乎连脖⼦都没了，却蓄着⼀脸⼤胡⼦。德思礼太太是个瘦削的⾦发⼥⼈。她的脖⼦⼏乎⽐正常⼈⻓⼀倍。这样每当她花许多时间隔着篱墙引颈⽽望、窥探左邻右舍时，她的⻓脖⼦可就派上了⼤⽤场。德思礼夫妇有⼀个⼩⼉⼦，名叫达⼒。在他们看来，⼈世间没有⽐达⼒更好的孩⼦了。"
